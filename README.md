# Decision Tree Analysis on Iris Dataset

## Overview
This project demonstrates a Decision Tree model applied to the popular Iris dataset. The goal is to classify different types of iris flowers based on several features, using a machine learning model.



## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Iris dataset, which consists of 150 samples of iris flowers with 4 features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width).

## Summary
A Decision Tree classifier is trained on the dataset, and its performance is evaluated based on accuracy and visualizations.
